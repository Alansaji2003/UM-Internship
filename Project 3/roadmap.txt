Phase 1: Planning and Preparation
Define Requirements and Scope:

Gather detailed functional and non-functional requirements.
Define scope, including core features (admin and user modules), and prioritize based on business goals.
System Architecture and Design:

Design system architecture considering scalability and Firebase integration.
Create wireframes and UI/UX designs for key screens (admin dashboard, shop listings, product details).
Technology Stack Selection:

Confirm tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a framework like React or Vue.js), Firebase for database.
Set up GitHub repository with initial README outlining project structure, workflow, and coding standards.
Phase 2: Frontend Development
UI/UX Design Implementation:

Develop responsive UI using HTML, CSS (considering Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development), and JavaScript frameworks like React.
Implement Firebase Authentication for user login and secure access.
User Module Development:

Implement frontend for user functionalities:
Category-wise product listings and details.
Product offers, comparison, and filtering.
Viewing shop details and floor-specific information.
Phase 3: Backend Development
Firebase Integration:

Set up Firebase project and configure Firestore for database operations.
Implement Firebase Cloud Functions for backend logic (e.g., managing shop details, offers).
Admin Module Development:

Develop admin dashboard for:
Login authentication and authorization.
CRUD operations for managing shops, offers, categories, and floors.
Phase 4: Integration and Testing
API Integration:

Connect frontend and backend components via Firebase APIs (Firestore, Authentication).
Ensure seamless data flow between UI and database.
Testing:

Write unit tests for frontend components using Jest or similar frameworks.
Conduct integration tests to validate end-to-end functionality (user login, shop management).
Phase 5: Deployment and Optimization
Deployment Strategy:

Deploy frontend to a cloud platform (e.g., Firebase Hosting, Netlify).
Host backend services using Firebase Cloud Functions or consider other serverless options.
Performance Optimization:

Optimize frontend and backend code for speed and efficiency.
Implement caching strategies (Firebase caching, client-side caching) for improved performance.
Phase 6: Documentation and Finalization
Documentation:

Complete README with setup instructions, project workflow, and codebase structure on GitHub.
Prepare solution design strategies (LLD document) and system architecture (wireframe and architecture documents).
Project Review and Submission:

Conduct final testing and review against project evaluation metrics (modularity, safety, testability, maintainability, portability).
Submit project with comprehensive documentation and ensure compliance with all outlined requirements.
